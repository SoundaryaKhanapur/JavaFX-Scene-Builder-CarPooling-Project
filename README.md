# Car Pooling - Java/JavaFx Scene Builder
This is a standalone application, as part of a global green initiative that allows users to register as vehicle owners or passengers to participate in day-to-day carpooling. The user selects his/her route and starting point. Based on the vacancy appropriate passengers are added and pooled with the vehicle owner. A separate register is maintained to track the userâ€™s pooling activities, and appropriate incentives are provided to encourage carpooling.

The application is developed in object-oriented Java/JavaFX Scene Builder. This brings out the advantage of object-oriented programming and helps in a better understanding of OOPS, concepts. The application makes use of file I/O to maintain the application state and user register. 
JavaFX being the latest update of Java Swing provides ease of UI design and event handling mechanism.
